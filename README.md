# Ruby on Rails API + Nextjs

I have created a full-stack app with the functionality of adding and deleting Providers on the front end by using CRUD APIs.

For testing I have used Rspec for Ruby and JEST + testing-library React 

to execute Rspec use "rspec" and for testing-library use "yarn run test"

## Installation and Start


```bash
1) In frontend directory do -> yarn install
2) docker-compose build
3) docker-compose up

```
